I implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) in this project to enhance user experience, making the software more intuitive and user-friendly. This addition allows users to visualize changes more directly, streamlining interactions and improving the overall efficiency of the workflow.

I included buttons to easily control the operations of the testing process, providing a more interactive and user-friendly way to manage and execute tests.

To further enhance the testing experience, I incorporated audio feedback using .wav files.
