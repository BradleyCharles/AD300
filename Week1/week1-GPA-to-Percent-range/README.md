I implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) in this project to enhance user experience, making the software more intuitive and user-friendly. This addition allows users to visualize changes more directly, streamlining interactions and improving the overall efficiency of the workflow.

I also integrated a dropdown menu element, enabling users to test multiple results without needing to manually adjust parameters each time. This feature significantly improves usability by allowing for quick comparisons and streamlined testing, ultimately enhancing the softwareâ€™s efficiency and user experience.
